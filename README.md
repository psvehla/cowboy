# Cowboy

A simple desert cowboy game for testing GenAI.

`index.html` and the `game.js` it references were generated by aider.

Claude's `desert_cowboy_game.html` probably has the best code, but is incomplete (ran out of conversation length), so doesn't work.

ChatGPT o4-mini-high made `gpt_cowboy.html`, probably the best one that actually works.
